# Reactor DI Documentation

Welcome to the Reactor DI documentation. This is a code generator for dependency injection (DI) in Python based on the mediator and factory patterns.

## Overview

Reactor DI provides two powerful decorators:
- `@module` - For module-level dependency configuration
- `@law_of_demeter` - For enforcing the Law of Demeter principle

## Installation

```bash
pip install reactor-di
```

## Quick Start

Usage examples will be added when the decorators are implemented.

## API Reference

See the [API documentation](api.md) for detailed information about the decorators.
